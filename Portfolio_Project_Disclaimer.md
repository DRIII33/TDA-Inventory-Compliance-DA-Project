### **Project Context and Use of Information**

This portfolio project, titled **"TDA Inventory Compliance and Transfer Optimization,"** is an independent, demonstrative data analysis exercise. It is designed to showcase proficiency in data modeling, business intelligence visualization, and algorithmic problem-solving within a real-world supply chain and compliance context.

**Alignment with Public Job Description:** The scope, metrics, and ultimate goal of this project—proactively identifying spoilage risk and optimizing inventory transfers—are directly aligned with the key responsibilities and analytical requirements outlined in the publicly available job description for the **TDA - F\&N - Food Distribution Specialist - Level 1 (Data Analyst) (56976) (00054076)** role.

**Methodology and Data Integrity:**
* The project was executed using the structured **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** framework to ensure a clear, objective progression from business understanding to deployment.
* The data used in this project—including entity names, product inventories, usage, and dates—is **entirely synthetic** and was created based on publicly accessible program guidelines and industry-standard challenges.
* The realism of the **Synthetic Data** was informed by research into common public food distribution inventory rules, specifically the **6 Months of Hold (6MOH)** compliance mandate, which dictates the key metrics, risk tiers, and transfer logic utilized in the BigQuery and Python components.

**Disclaimer Regarding Entities:**
The mention of "USDA," "TDA," "Contracting Entities (CEs)," or "Processors (PROCs)" is purely for contextual accuracy and to build a realistic scenario based on publicly documented government programs and terminology.
