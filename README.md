**Portfolio Project:** Proactive USDA Foods Inventory Compliance
**Project Title:** USDA Foods Inventory Risk & Utilization Dashboard: Proactively Identifying Non-Compliance
**GitHub Repository Name:** TDA-Inventory-Compliance-DA-Project
**I. Business Scenario & Problem**
**A. Business Scenario**
The Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA), Food and Nutrition Division, is responsible for administering over $2.5 billion in federal USDA Foods annually. A core compliance requirement for all Contracting Entities (CEs) and Processors is managing inventory efficiently. Federal regulations (7 CFR 250.12(c)) generally mandate that USDA Foods inventory levels must not exceed a six-month supply (6MOH) to prevent waste, spoilage, and misuse of federal assets. Non-compliance results in significant administrative burden and potential federal penalties.
**B. Business Problem (The "Why")**
TDA currently relies on a manual review of Processor Monthly Performance Reports (MPRs) to identify non-compliance after it has occurred. Given recent supply chain volatility (e.g., the 2025 meat component disruption), the risk of excess inventory (6MOH violations) or stagnant inventory (products approaching "Best-If-Used-By" dates) is high.
**The Goal:** Develop a proactive data analysis solution to quickly and accurately identify entities at high risk of a 6MOH violation before the violation is officially logged, enabling the Data Analyst to issue technical guidance and coordinate transfers ("Review and process transfer requests") to resolve the issue proactively.
